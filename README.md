## Important ‚ÄºÔ∏è

SlimeKt's server was hosted at Heroku but as they dismissed their free plan, the app does not works as expected. You can clone the repo and start the Ktor server locally (Please refer the Backend section below).
Meanwhile these days I'm also exploring NextJS with Typescript so I plan to recreate SlimeKT's backend using the same stack.

## Introduction üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

An article sharing platform where you can _**personalize, subscribe to your favorite topics, get
daily-read reminders, explore new authors, and share your articles**_. App built using Kotlin, Dagger Hilt, Room Database, Coroutines, Flow, AndroidX Glance, WorkManager, Coil etc.</b>

## Documentation üìö

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visit-blue?style=for-the-badge)](https://kasem-sm.github.io/SlimeKT)

We have prepared a detailed guide on every feature, API route, and project structure. Please

major folder, such as [`/api`](/api) and [`/features`](/features), contains short documentation in
the Github repository itself.

## Repository overview üìÇ

SlimeKT has its backend built with Ktor. The folder [`/api`](/api) consists of our backend deployed
